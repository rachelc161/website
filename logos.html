          <h1><b>Logo Design...</b></h1>
      <p>Below are a selection of logos that I have created throughout my foundation degree. I have tried to keep the logos as simple as possible and keep all my designs clean and professional...</p>

             <h1>'Sky - Spa and Thalasso'<br></h1>
                 <p>This logo was created for as part of a group assignment. It is for a Spa that is within a michellin star hotel. This logo has to be clean and easy to read whilst still maintaining its appeal towards the adult audience. It must work both on a large scale and a smaller scale so it can appear on products.<br><br>
                 
                 I decided to use a selection of cold colours in order to make this logo relaxing and soothing for the eye. This is for a spa, therefore it needs to make people relaxed, so the use of cold colours helps relax the clients whilst they are in the spa.

             <h1>'BT1 - Bar and Restaurant'<br></h1>
                 <p>This logo was created for as part of a group assignment. It is for a Bar and restaurant that is within a michellin star hotel. This logo has to be clean and easy to read whilst still maintaining its appeal towards the adult audience. It must work both on a large scale and a smaller scale so it can appear on products.<br><br>
                     
                I decided to use a grey scale logo as it is cleaner and much more professional looking. People sitting in this expensive restaurant will not want to look at a brightly coloured logo. Therefore a greyscale logo is much simpler and appealing towards the selected audience.

             <h1>'MVRDV - Architects'<br></h1>
                 <p>Inspired by the Bauhaus art movement this is a logo for an architects company. The Bauhaus period focused around the use of primary colours. This logo has to be clean and easy to read whilst still maintaining its appeal towards the adult audience.<br><br>
                     
                    I decided to keep this logo mainly black and white with a slight hint of the bauhaus period through the primary colours alternating on the stroke of the letters. I used the angle marks on the lines so that this logo could relate to the architects company and the way they draw their plans for buildings.

             <h1>'NRC - Fashion and Textiles'<br></h1>
                 <p>After getting a logo for our own Interactive Digital Media Department, I was approached by the Fashion and Textiles Department to create a logo for their department. I used the navy colour from the NRC logo, this helps to link each department to NRC as a whole.<br><br>
                     
                I used the same fonts that were to be featured throughout the rest of the creative departments logos. One script font and one sans serif font. Using two different fonts helps to distinguish between different elements of the logo. Similar to before I used the script font for the department and the sans serif for the body text.

             <h1>'CQ - On your bike'<br></h1>
                 <p>A project aimed at students that will be living in the new University halls of residence in Belfast that is currently under construction. In groups we had to come up with an advertising campaign that would appeal to potential students and persuade them to come and live in the Cathedral Quarter. <br><br>
                     
                'Take a hike on your Belfast bike' was our idea behind this is that students don't have a lot of money and they may struggle with transport. The Cathedral Quarter was packed full of bikes, therefore this would be a great and cheap way for students to get around.
