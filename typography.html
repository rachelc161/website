          <h1><b>Typography...</b></h1>
      <p>I am very interested in typography and all aspects of lettering. I am currently trying my hand at both sketching and digital typography. I am going to try and make some of my typography posters etc available for printing...</p>

         <div class="large-6 medium-6 small-12 columns"> 
             
             <h1>'Procrastination'<br></h1>
                 <p>Typography sketch inspired by Jessica Hiche, I liked how Jessica Hiche has used a seleciton of fonts in order to create this illustrated quote. This was originally in colour whenever Hiche originally created it, but i decided to complete it in black and white. <br><br>
                     
                I am really inspired by jessica Hiche and her lettering, I think she is amazing at typography and creating new fonts. I decided to complete this typography illustration in the hopes of helping to understand which fonts compliment each other the best and some layouts I could use when creating typography posters myself.

         <div class="large-6 medium-6 small-12 columns"> 
             
             <h1>'Whiskey'<br></h1>
                 <p>This is another one of Jessica Hiches' pieces that I decided to illustrate myself. I really liked the curve that was created in the lettering and how some of the text is wrote on the curve and some of it is wrote on a straight line. <br><br>
                     
                In order to recreate this myself I had to use a few rulers and also a protractor and a compass so that I could get all the lines perfectly straight and the curves to have just the right angle and arch. This has taught me how to wrtie lettering on different paths and the multiple techniques that it takes to do so.

             <h1>'Ink and Water'<br></h1>
                 <p>This was a piece I had originally seen on Pinterest. I was very inpired by the idea of creating a perfect piece of lettering to then only have it destroyed with some water. I completed the lettering first in pencil and then once I was happy with the design I went over in pen and filled it in.<br><br>
                
                I then went in with some water colour paint to smudge the lettering and begin to show the effects that water would have on ink and how it would run down the page and ruin the art. This piece of typography taught me how to use different tools to create effects and that some pieces don't just simply use a pen and paper.
