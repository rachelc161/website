          <h1><b>Mens Buns and Beards...</b></h1>
      <p>The Mens, Buns and Beards project is probably one of the biggest projects i have completed to date. it involved a new hipster barbershop coming to belfast and they needed all their brnading and designing completed for their grand opening. This included a Logo, Poster, Menus and a Website... </p>

             <h1>'Logo Design'<br></h1>
                 <p>This is the logo for the barbershop, I researched into this and thought of a few ideas for a logo. Originally I thought about trying to incorporate a cupcake in some way, but after considering the hipster audience that this would be appealing towards I decided against this. Using a cupcake was too obvious and too cheesy. <br> <br>
                     
                     I thought the best way to make this look clean and professional was to focus around the text. Making text the main focus will prevent this logo from looking cheesy and unprofessional. Making the word 'Emporium' the main focus will help attract the hipster audience towards this barbershop because it seems like more than just a barberhsop.

             <h1>'posters'<br></h1>
                 <p>I decided to create three different poster designs for this barbershop, I wanted to ensure that I was going to appeal to as many different people as possible and I know how difficult it can be to appeal to someone who is quite hipster and out there. Having three posters was how i thought it would be best to appeal to all the different people. <br><br>
                     
                I decided to use an old fashioned black and white style barbershop image in the background of this poster. The text is minimal and doesn't distract from the overall look of the poster.

         <div class="large-6 medium-6 small-12 columns"> 
             
                 <p>In this poster I decided to use some copper highlights. In the brief we were given specific colours that the barbershop wished to use throughout their whole shop therefore I thought it would be wise to incorporate these throughout the branding as well. This helps link the whole shop together. <br> <br>
                     
                     This poster is very minimal and just focuses on a plain navy background colour with the copper text coming through, this copper is minimal but it certainly helps to add to the overall look of the poster.<br><br>
                     
                     I kept the logo in white so that it didn't stand out as much as the copper, but it still caught the eye of the audience.

                 <p>This was the final poster that I created. I decided to use the green from the colour scheme, the green seemed like quite a dark and different type of colour for a barbershop to use therefore I wanted to challenge myself to incorporate it into at least one of my designs. <br><br>
                     
                     I decided to use the chesterfield sofa in this poster because in my opinion it is a very hipster sofa and is the style of sofa I would imagine to be used in the waiting area of this barbershop. <br><br>
                     
                     I also think the use of this sofa helps to give off the vibe that this poster is actually a waiting room in itself. This is something that wouldnt be seen by the regular eye at first glance but after further study may become apparent.
